<h1>Single Page Applications</h1>
   <h3><pre>Sinle page Applications are webapps where new value is
   uploaded to the page withoutthe need to refreshing your page.
   For example in gmail, you do not need to refresh your inbox 
   to see if there is a new mail. The new mail, if any 
   automatically appears in your inbox. Such apps are developed
   using the technology called 'Ajax' .It is an acronym for
   Asynchronous javaScript and XML.

   <h3><pre>Ajax allows webpages to be uploaded automatically. 
   By exchanging data with a web server in a backround process. 
   It is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the
   whole page.
